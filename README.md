## About

**GradGate** is a **Student Recruitment Application** built using **Flutter** for the frontend and **MySQL** (managed with **XAMPP**) for the backend. The app provides a minimal and intuitive interface that allows students to apply for jobs and internships, companies to post opportunities and manage applicants, and colleges to track the employment or internship status of their students. With streamlined data management and easy customization options, users can navigate and perform tasks efficiently.

### Features
- **Student Applications:** Students can browse job postings (full-time or internship) and apply.
- **Company Dashboard:** Companies can post jobs, view applications, shortlist candidates, and send confirmations.
- **College Overview:** Colleges can see a list of students from their institution who have been placed in jobs or internships.
- **Minimal UI:** A user-friendly interface that provides a seamless experience.
- **Data Management:** Efficient handling of data, allowing users to easily manage applications, postings, and records.
- **Customizable Views:** Each user type (student, company, college) can have a tailored experience.

> **Note:** This application currently simulates the backend functionality using localhost. Future updates will include hosting on a live server for broader access and enhanced features.
